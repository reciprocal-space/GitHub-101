    "Before we get started there are a few things to know. GitHub is a web-based service that employs the Git version control system for tracking changes in files. This makes it easy to collaborate with others on projects, especially those containing computer code, as any user can make contributions to the document and GitHub will track the changes - the key point being that each user can easily make changes to a document without overwriting it because Git takes a snapshot of your work at every instance of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub workflow is structured to make collaboration easy and efficient. Each project you create is hosted in its own directory or 'repository', with the components of the project (e.g. individual files containing specific code) hosted on the 'master' branch. Collaborators can then stem off Master and create their own branches. The work a collaborator does on their own branch is separate from the Master, and it is therefore easy for multiple collaborators to work on a project without any interference or loss of work. Once  a collaborator has their work ready, or they would like someone to review the changes they have made, they can issue a 'Pull Request'. Other project members can then review the changes made to the project before 'merging' these changes back to the master branch. Finally, an 'Issue' on GitHub is something that needs attention; it could be a feature that needs to be added to the project, or it could be bug in a certain piece of code that needs to be fixed. Github lets you label, search, and assign Issues, making project management much easier. \n",
