# GitHub-101
An Introduction to GitHub

This repository was created as a final project for a Technical Writing course. The motivation behind its creation was to help new users quickly get started with the GitHub platform using elements of effective design and communication learned in class.

The document, found in the repository's wiki, was initially created in a Jupyter Notebook, and design features were tailored using Markdown.
